### Install unitree_sdk2py (For Real Deployment)

`unitree_sdk2py` is a library used for communication with real robots. If you need to deploy the trained model on a physical robot, install this library.

#### Download

Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python.git
```

#### Install

Navigate to the directory and install it:

```bash
cd unitree_sdk2_python
pip install -e .
```






# Deploy on Physical Robot


### 1. Start the robot

Start the robot in the hoisting state and wait for the robot to enter `zero torque mode`

### 2. Enter the debugging mode

Make sure the robot is in `zero torque mode`, press the `L2+R2` key combination of the remote control; the robot will enter the `debugging mode`, and the robot joints are in the damping state in the `debugging mode`.


### 3. Connect the robot

Use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer to the network port on the robot. Modify the network configuration as follows

Then use the `ifconfig` command to view the name of the network interface connected to the robot. Record the network interface name, which will be used as a parameter of the startup command later

### 4. Start the program

Assume that the network card currently connected to the physical robot is named `enp3s0`.

```bash
python deploy_real.py enp3s0 h1_2.yaml
```

#### 4.1 Zero torque state

After starting, the robot joints will be in the zero torque state. You can shake the robot joints by hand to feel and confirm.

#### 4.2 Default position state

In the zero torque state, press the `start` button on the remote control, and the robot will move to the default joint position state.

After the robot moves to the default joint position, you can slowly lower the hoisting mechanism to let the robot's feet touch the ground.

#### 4.3 Motion control mode

After the preparation is completed, press the `A` button on the remote control, and the robot will step on the spot. After the robot is stable, you can gradually lower the hoisting rope to give the robot a certain amount of space to move.

<!-- At this time, you can use the joystick on the remote control to control the movement of the robot.
The front and back of the left joystick controls the movement speed of the robot in the x direction
The left and right of the left joystick controls the movement speed of the robot in the y direction
The left and right of the right joystick controls the movement speed of the robot's yaw angle -->

#### 4.4 Exit control

In motion control mode, press the `select` button on the remote control, the robot will enter the damping mode and fall down, and the program will exit. Or use `ctrl+c` in the terminal to close the program.
